Hi! I am Deven. Welcome to my little blog. I am a final year Electrical Engineering student. I started this blog for three reasons. First, I want to improve my communication skill, especially sharing ideas. Second, I want to share my perspectives and thoughts on interesting stuff. Third, I use this blog to reinforce my knowledge. Well, writing always makes you know what you don't know. This is a living document of my learning progress!

I'm also a big believer in open discussion. So, if you disagree with something on this blog, I am happy to discuss it! That way, we can grow together.
