Start learning to program in 2019 by playing with C. First met deep learning through Computer Vision class(elective course). I don't even know if I can pass it. Since then, AI, ML and deep learning become my interest.

I write this blog because of 3 reasons.
- Improve my communications skills. Especially on how to share my ideas.
- To write about something that I found interesting.
- Well, wise man said "to really understand something, summarize them". So, i write to summarize.
