My first encounter of AI programming was through Computer Vision class(elective course). I took the class to challenge myself even though I have zero experience of programming. To my excitement, I passed it!. The next semester I took a compulsory programming course called Computer System and Programming Principles which required me to learn C. Also passed it!

Since then, I become interested in AI, ML and DL.

Three reasons why I blog.
- Improve my communications skills. Especially on how to share my ideas.
- To write about something that I found interesting.
- Well, wise men said, "to understand something, summarize it". So, I write to summarize.
