1+ year after graduation, I am very fortunate to be involved in almost every parts of real world software development. For summary, 
- Hardware - Using C and Python to interatct with GPIO on Raspberry PI and Nvidia Jetson Nano.
- Machine Learning - Core developer for chatbot, and face recognition. Using Python ML library - PyTorch, Keras & Tensorflow
- Backend - Product owner of an open source labelling tools, [Classifai](https://github.com/CertifaiAI/classifai). Building backend with Java reactive web framework - Vert.x

In my free time, I like to build side project. And I realize, without frontend skills, personal project is not complete. That is when I started to pick up the skills. Since Classifai is using Angular frontend, that is my starting point.

And [gerbang.space](https://www.gerbang.space/) is born as a "final exam" project. Now this website has been ported to Next.js hosted on Vercel. Mainly because of React and SSR. Not because of SEO benefit, but more to loading speed. For the backend, this is using Django and hosted on Heroku with Postgress database. The important component of this website is the automated data pipeline which is build on Twint and Pandas, running on Digitalocean. Certainly Heroku free version is not able to handle the memory requirement.

## Progressing in learning

My way of learning is by doing. And the side project definitely supercharge the process. I'm thinking of integrating NLP into the pipeline. But how will this be useful to viewers. Data alone is not useful without a good presentation. That is when UI/Frontend comes into place. 

Anyway, I'm excited to dive deep into the ecosystem! And yeah.. Web 3.0
