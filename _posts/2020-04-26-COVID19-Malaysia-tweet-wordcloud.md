title: Exploring Malaysian covid19 tweets with WordCloud
---
This simple project is to explore the value of word cloud plot. I am exploring Malaysian COVID19 Twitter tweets.

Full dataset:
- [Coronavirus (covid19) Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/coronavirus-covid19-tweets)

The original dataset combines tweets from other countries. I have filtered the tweets based on county_code = 'MY'. The result produce 4785 lines of tweets to explore. I only take a few meaningful columns, which are tweet, retweet_count, favourites_count, created_at, and lang.

4785 rows Ã— 5 columns
```
Columns: text, retweet_count, favourites_count, created_at, lang

As you can see, there are lots of garbage characters and emojis. In some cases, HTML tags exist. If not cleaned carefully, they can cause noise to the dataset as some tag exists frequently and are comparable to other words.

## Cleaning & Preprocessing

```python
def unicodeToAscii(s):
    return ''.join(
        c for c in unicodedata.normalize('NFD', s)
        if unicodedata.category(c) != 'Mn'
    )

table = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
def clean_string(tweet):
    tweet = re.sub(r'http\S+', '', tweet) # remove links
    tweet = re.sub('#\S+', '', tweet)  # remove hashtags
    tweet = re.sub('@\S+', '', tweet)  # remove mentions
    tweet = re.sub('&\S+', '', tweet) # remove html entities
    tweet = tweet.translate(table).lower() # remove punctuations and lower all letters
    tweet = unicodeToAscii(tweet.lower().strip()) # normalize ascii
    tweet = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z]+', r' ', tweet) # clean all non-letter string
    return tweet.strip()
```
From the snippets above, I decide to remove some parts of the tweet that is not useful. The removed parts are links, hashtag, mentions, HTML entities and punctuations. Hashtags are helpful to decide the tweet topic. However, for this task, I remove them as they are not part of the sentence.

```python
vocab = {}
for s in df_text:
  for w in s.split():
    if w not in vocab:
      vocab[w] = 1
    else:
      vocab[w] += 1
      
vocab = collections.OrderedDict(sorted(vocab.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True))
```
Combine all words and record the number of usages. Sort words according to its frequency of occurrences.

## Plotting wordcloud

```python
text = ' '.join([(k + ' ')*v for k, v in vocab.items()])
# lower max_font_size
# by default max_words is 200
wordcloud = WordCloud(width=500, height=250, max_font_size=40,
                      background_color='white', collocations=False).generate(text)
fig = plt.figure()
plt.imshow(wordcloud)
plt.axis('off')
plt.savefig('/content/drive/My Drive/covidcloud.png')
plt.show()
```
To plot the dictionary, I am using the wordcloud library. You can view the [documentation here](http://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/). I am using the minimal example from the docs.

As you notice from the comment, the default value is set to 200. I found out that setting max_words more than 200 will not add value to the visualization as the image will be too crowded.

## Conclusion


I find that wordcloud plot helps to understand the big picture of corpus sentiment. It can be an initial analysis which is simple enough to help us:

1) observe the effectiveness of data cleaning
    - Are there any non-human words exists? Tags? Weird stuff?
2) direct our output goals 
    - Setting output class assumption.
    - Is the dataset balance?

For example, Malaysians, in general, are supportive of government orders of movement restriction. This hypothesis is evident from the prominent words such as ```rumah, kawalan, pergerakan, kawalan, stay, perintah``` and many more. This plot also gives a good sign that the corpus can be used to analyze How government orders affect Malaysians, which can be classified as ```effective``` vs ```not effective```.
