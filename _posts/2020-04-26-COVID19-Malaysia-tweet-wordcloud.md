title: Simple wordcloud to understand Malaysian COVID19 tweet
published: false
---
This simple project is to explore an open source Twitter dataset on COVID19. I am interested only for Malaysian tweets.

Full dataset:
- [Coronavirus (covid19) Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/coronavirus-covid19-tweets)

The original dataset combines tweets from other countries. I have filter the tweets based on county_code = 'MY'. This gives me 4000+ lines of tweets to play with.
