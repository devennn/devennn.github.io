title: Good data > good algorithm
---

The first time I played with beginner kaggle challenge, Titanic, I am so excited with the possibilities of Machine learning. But not so on data preprocessing. I want to quickly get my hands dirty with the scikit learn algorithm. 

It took me a day to do basic data preprocessing. I fill up the empty cells, replace strings with one-hot encoding and removing columns with too much empty cells. I end up having formatted dataset with lots of columns and I thought that would be enough.

Then come the best part. Training the model. I made a functions which run all the data using some famous algorithm such as Random Forest, SVM, Linear Regression, AdaBoost and KNN. My strategy is simple. 

- Run the data using all algorithm
- Evaluate result for highest accuracy.
- Run grid search

For me, that seem to be a good strategy. Whatever the grid search suggest is the best parametrs of the model. I got 67%.

Whatever I tried to tweak, it does not get better +-0.5% . That makes me wonder, What more can I do?. Than I came across a suggestion to group the passengers age. For example, 0 - 7 is children, 30 - 100 is adult and so on. Run the new data again, boom, goes up to 70%.

That is when I know, preprocessing is important in producing predictive model with Machine learning. Thus, whenever I do simple project, I remind myself, good data produce good model. Remember feature Engineering!
