I am working on a big topic - Making Smart Home Smarter. We have options to do a research related to smart home system, hardware or software. After doing lots of reading, I decided to explore on the possibilities of smart home system to have more understanding about human.

My title is: Making smart home system more friendly using emotional data

### Prior research

According to [Alam et al](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2189204), smart home can bring comfort in two ways. Identification of human activity and event automation in local environments. I am interested in exploring more into identifying human activity. Study from [Superflux Lab](https://superflux.in/index.php/work/uninvited-guests/#) get my interest. The question is “ What role does human play in world where mundane objects begin to gain level of autonomy? ”.

This is particularly in the elderly monitoring. Smart home technology has been inclined towards the goal. Invetion of smart walking stick with remote monitoring capability for example helps children to see how are their parents doing. Are they getting enough steps? Where are they going today? This might be a good idea if we focus on what caretakers can do with it. But, not so much for the person being taken care.

It seems like this technology is treating the caretaker as human, and the person being taken care as object. The technology does not take into account how might the person being take care of will feel about it.

A study from [Antonio et al](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-13105-4_50) said that "Quality of life is the perceived quality of the daily life of an individual, the appreciation of being of a person. It includes emotional, social and physical aspects in a person’s life.” This makes me think that if we want to build a smart home technology, why not build something that take into account, not just physical aspects, but also menatal aspects, the emotion. Emotional need is as important as physical need.

### Defining the problem

True, there are lots of research has been done to detect human emotion and react based on it. Study by [mano et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366416300688?via%3Dihub) used emotional data to make decisions such as giving suggestions to have a break or a cup of coffee if the person is stressed. There aare also smart home technolgy that use computer vision to detect human emotion and act on it.

In my opinion, these proposed technolgy are one sided. What i mean is, the system only work based on what it think is the best. Of course, human does that too. But we don't give the same suggestion everytime. For example, when someone is having heartbreak the 1st time, we may give them word of encouragement. But when it happens the 7th times, we may do different, maybe take them to a counseling session because we know this is very bad. We decide based on perspective. 

Smart home should have perspective too. Smart home should be able to make decisions based on perspective.

### Proposed Idea

I am proposing that instead of system giving one solution to a problem, it gives more. This is a recommendation system. Much like when we watch video on Youtube, it gives few recommendations. Whichever the person choose, the system will learn on it. And when the next time, when we choose differently, it gives more suggestions based on our new choice and less of the old one.

The system work based on detecting pattern and them giving recommendation.
