I am working on a big topic - Making Smart Home Smarter. We have options to do research related to the smart home system, hardware or software.

My title is _"Making the smart home system more friendly using emotional data."_

### Prior research

According to [Alam et al](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2189204), smart home can bring comfort in two ways. Identification of human activity and event automation in local environments. I am interested in exploring more into identifying human activity. A study from [Superflux Lab](https://superflux.in/index.php/work/uninvited-guests/#) gives me some idea on it. The question is "What role does human play in a world where mundane objects begin to gain a level of autonomy?".

The invention of a smart walking stick with remote monitoring capability, for example, helps users to monitor their parents. Are they getting enough steps? Where are they going today? The idea is good if we focus on what caretakers can do with it. But, not so much for the person under care.

A study from [Antonio et al](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-13105-4_50) said that "Quality of life is the perceived quality of the daily life of an individual, the appreciation of being of a person. It includes emotional, social and physical aspects in a person's life." It makes me think that smart home technologies need to take into account, not just physical aspects, but also mental aspects, the emotion. The emotional need is as vital as physical need.

### Defining the problem

True, there are lots of research has been done to detect human emotion and react based on it. A study by [mano et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366416300688?via%3Dihub) used emotional data to make decisions such as giving suggestions to have a break or a cup of coffee if the person is stressed. There are also smart home technologies that use computer vision to detect human emotion and act on it.

In my opinion, these technologies are one-sided because the system only work based on what it thinks is the best. Of course, humans do that too. But we don't give the same suggestion every time. For example, when someone has heartbreak for the 1st time, we provide them with words of encouragement. But when it happens the 7th times, we may do differently, maybe take them to a counselling session. We decide based on perspective. 

Smart home technologies should decide based on perspective as well. A smart home should be able to make decisions based on viewpoint.

### Proposed Idea

I am proposing that instead of the system, giving one solution to a problem, it provides more like a recommendation system. When users watch videos on Youtube, it gives a few recommendations. Whichever the person choose, the system will learn on it. Recommendation system work based on pattern detection.
