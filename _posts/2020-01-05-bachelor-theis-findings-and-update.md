title: Bachelor thesis - Update and findings
---

In the past months, I did lots of interviews to establish the topic before working on the code.

#### Thesis title:
> Making smart home more friendly using emotional data

### Investigation Methods

I conducted two interviews which focus on different goals.

The first interview is more of getting to know what people think about the smart home, how smart home works and trying to understand their worries regarding the topic.

The second interview is based on design fiction to dig deeper into the central issue from the first interview. I created a sample Smart home control panel where they can see what data collected and how to control the system (e.g. turning off sensors). I structured the questions to investigate specifically on the privacy issue. Exploring these issues will help to understand how to collect data in someone's home.

### Interesting Findings

#### Smart home is inevitable

My speculation on privacy issue is not wrong. Data collections methods such as cameras and motion sensors would not gain favour from users.

But, I find it interesting when they mention the application of smart home and how it will benefit them. For example, they would say that it will help them to be more organized. And it doesn't seem to stop them talking about the benefits even though we spoke about privacy issues before. They assume that this technology will be one day be in everyone's home.

#### "Jarvis" effect

Most of the participant mentioned Jarvis from Ironman movie when they heard about smart homes. The idea of Jarvis helps them to see the possibilities of this technology as human personal assistants.

The Jarvis effect can be a way to introduce smart home. For example, Jarvis-like video introduction/explanation to educate them about smart homes, privacy issues and ethics.

#### People would consider a trade-off for privacy

This is related to the privacy issue. I asked participants if they will consider giving out data if they will receive something (e.g. discount, rewards, etc.). Some of them agree, and some will accept based on the benefits.

I conclude that people will tend to compromise their privacy if they receive something â€” a Win-win situation.

### Final Thoughts

I think most of their knowledge about smart home technology is either "Jarvis" or "spy my family". In other words, "smart home can benefit me" or "Companies are bad at keeping my privacy". People need education related to smart home and privacy to open up possibilities of data collection at home.
