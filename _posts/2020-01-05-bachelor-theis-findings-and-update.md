title: Bachelor thesis - Update and findings
---

Most of the work being done in the past months are interviews. This is to establish the topic before actually working on the code. Since I am working on Smart home, which is very personal to people, exploring the data collection technique is crucial.

#### Thesis title:
> Making smart home more friendly using emotional data

### Investigation Methods

I conducted 2 interviews which focus on different goals.

The first interview is more of getting to know what people think about smart home, how smart home works and trying to understand their worries regarding smart home.

The second interview is design fiction based to dig deeper on the main issue from first interview. I created a sample Smart home control panel where they can see what data has been collected and how to control the system (eg. turning off sensors). I stuctured the questions to investigate specifically on the privacy issue. Exploring this issues will help to understand how to collect data in someone's home. This can be controversial since home is very personal. So, i have to emphasize to them that they can choose not to answer.

### Interesting Findings

#### Smart home is inevitable

My speculation on privacy issue is not wrong. Many people, when they heared about how the data will be taken, especially camera, would reject the idea. Even if I mention that it will make the smart home system better.

But, I find it interesting when they mention about the application of smart home and how it will benefit them. For example, they would say that it will help them to be more organized. And it doesn't seem to stop them talking about the benefits eventhough we talked about issues first. I think they will assume that this technology will be one day be in everyone's home.

#### "Jarvis" effect

Almost 60 % of the participant mention about Jarvis from Ironman movie. Most of them does not have technology background nor interested in the technology. I can see that movies help them to see the possibilities of smart home helping human. The only is they do not understand what it takes to get there. The data, algorithm, training, etc.

The jarvis effect can be a way to introduce smart home. Maybe making jarvis like video introduction/explanation plus how the data are collected will help to educate most people.

#### People would consider a trade off for privacy

This is related to the privacy issue. I asked them if they will consider giving out their data if they will receive something (eg. discount, rewards, etc.). Some of them said that they will, and some said depends on the rewards. What can I conclude is people will have the tendency to compromise their privacy if they will receive something. Win - win situation.

### Final Thoughts

I think most of their knowledge about smart home is either "Jarvis" or "I am being spied". In other words, "smart home can bring me benefit" vs "Companies are bad at keeping my privacy". If companies are able to solve this problem and gain trust, it will open up possibiliities to collect great information.
