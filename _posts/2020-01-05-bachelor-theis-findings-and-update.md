title: Bachelor thesis - Update and findings
---

Most of the work being done are further research. This is to establish the topic before actually working on the code. Since I am working on Smart home, privacy issue is a big deal. I can't just use someone's data without conscent since this is related to emotion So, I conducted 2 interviews to investigate further. Here are some of my findings.

#### Thesis title:
> Making smart home more friendly using emotional data

### Interesting Findings

#### Smart home is inevitable

My speculation on privacy issue is not wrong. Many people, when they heared about how the data will be taken, would reject the idea. Even if I mention that it will make the smart home system better.

But, I find it interesting when they mention about the application of smart home and how it will benefit them. For example, they would say that it will help them to be more organized. Despite all the issues, they think this technology will be one day be in everyone's home.

#### "Jarvis" effect

Almost 60 % of the participant mention about Jarvis from Ironman movie. Most of them does not have technology background nor interested in the technology. I think that movies help them to see the possibilities of smart home helping human. The only problem will be they do not understand what it takes to get there. The data, algorithm, training, etc.

The jarvis effect can be a way to introduce smart home. Maybe making jarvis like video introduction plus the how the data are collected will help to educate non-tech people.

#### People would consider a trade off for privacy


### Possible Hiccups

#### Unrealistic timeline

#### No ready available dataset
