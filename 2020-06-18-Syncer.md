I used Google Colab frequently to explore Machine Learning projects which make 30Gb (15Gb from each Gmail) not enough. Well, I'm not ready to pay for extra storage. So, what I did is create a new Gmail. You get the plan here... However, to transfer a 10Gb dataset to the new drive requires download to local, then upload to the destination. That's a lot of time needed. I need a direct transfer across cloud. One solution is using Multcloud. But, the free version crash often for me.


Then I found an open-source solution, RClone, which can be used via the command line. The process are multithreaded by default! Awesome! But, my storage directory level is deep, for some, up to 7 levels, because of that, I quickly forgot the path. And I'm not good with bash regex either. So, I build a simple GUI that interacts with RClone via the command line.
